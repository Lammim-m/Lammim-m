- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lammim-m
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more languages (both coding and actual spoken languages).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML & CSS, C#, and PYTHON.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on non-paid part time projects to learn more about coding and how functioning in a team looks like. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Email: LAMMIM287@GMAIL.COM.
